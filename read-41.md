# Review, Research, and Discussion

## 1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
Ducks is a method of modularizing React reducers, actions, and action types. Redux Toolkit is a package that intends to reduce some of the React boilerplate and be a standard way to write Redux logic.

## 2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
Reduction in boilerplate and access to Redux middleware

# Vocabulary Terms

**redux toolkit slices** a slice is a single key:value pair of state

**namespace** Similar to to object property access allows for accessing parts of a component using dot notation rather than a variable assignment



# Preparation Materials

## [getting started with react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
- "Views" are the building blocks of iphone and android apps
- React native allows for developing "native apps" that would otherwise be written in Kotlin or Java for Android and Swift or Obective-C for iOS
- Core components, essential ready to use native components already built and available

## [react native basics (Tutorial)](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial)
- `import { Text, View } from 'react-native';`
- Native components: `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `Button`, `StyleSheet`
