## Terminology
**Node** - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure

**Root** - The root is the first/top Node in the tree

**Left Child** - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node

**Right Child** - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node

**Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

**Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children

**Height** - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node


## Traversals

There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First
- Breadth First
