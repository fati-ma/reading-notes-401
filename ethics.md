# Ethics in the workplace

## [The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

The developer in this article talked about how he build a website for a company that sells dangerous drugs and how one of the girls that took that drug died!
He noticed the problem while he was building the website but continued building it, and after the girl's accident in a while he resigned.
This is some of what he says in the last:
"As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices.

We’re approaching a time where software will drive the vehicle that transports your family to soccer practice. There are already AI programs that help doctors diagnose disease. It’s not hard to imagine them recommending prescription drugs soon, too.

The more software continues to take over every aspect of our lives, the more important it will be for us to take a stand and ensure that our ethics are ever-present in our code.

Since that day, I always try to think twice about the effects of my code before I write it. I hope that you will too."
