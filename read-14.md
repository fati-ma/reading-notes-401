# Readings: Access Control (ACL)
## Read: 14 - Class-14
### Hello this is ***Fatima*** :smile:, welcome to my blog where I will share with you the notes I take during reading from the resources provided each class. :closed_book: :pencil2:
### You can visit my GitHub repo for the readings notes from [here](https://github.com/fati-ma/reading-notes-401) or this webpage markdown file using this [link](https://github.com/fati-ma/reading-notes-401/blob/main/read-14.md).


# Review, Research, and Discussion

## 1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
initially when the user first uses their username and password to log in, we use basic auth. then on subsequent calls to access privileged info we use bearer auth. So, Basic authorization used for a read only resource, and it should only be used with HTTPS . Bearer authoriztion uses a token and is more secure for an exchange between a client and a server.

## 2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
JWT creates a token using a secret that allows us to use bearer auth and make sure the token given by the user is valid (using the secret), in other words what it does is transmitting information as a JSON object. It is can be signed with a secret, whcih certifies that the only owner of the secret is the party the signed the JWT.

## 3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
Although not sure how will tests be run on GitHub, but storing secret value in the .env file that isn't accessible. The goal from a secret is to make sure nobody has access to it, to keep your app secure.


# Vocabulary Terms

**encryption** The method by which information is converted into a secret code that protects the data from being easily understood.
most successful encryption algorithms can't be decrypted.

**token** These are strings or JWTs that let an api know that the token bearer is authorized. allows the user and server to communicate while maintaining the identity of the user.

**bearer** identifies the person with the token as the person who is authorized to access the info. 
The bearer shows the token and is granted access to the resource or URL.

**secret** A string that is used to create a jwt token. This is often sent along with a client id to a resource to obtain a token. It is only known to the OAuth Client and the authorization server.

**JSON Web Token**  a standard that defines a way for transmitting information securely as a json object. the info can be verified and trusted because it's signed using a secret that only the server knows.
The tokens can be transmitted as query strings, header attributes, or in the body of a POST request. JWT is popular because of teh small size.

### What is RBAC?
RBAC is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

### Benefits of RBAC?
With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

The data breach you prevent may be your own.

**Access control lists (ACL)** â€” An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document
