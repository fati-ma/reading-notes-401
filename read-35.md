# Readings: Graphs
## Read: 35 - Implementation: Graphs

### Hello this is ***Fatima*** :smile:, welcome to my blog where I will share with you the notes I take during reading from the resources provided each class. :closed_book: :pencil2:
### You can visit my GitHub repo for the readings notes from [here](https://github.com/fati-ma/reading-notes-401) or this webpage markdown file using this [link](https://github.com/fati-ma/reading-notes-401/blob/main/read-35.md).


## Graph

**Graph** a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or `nodes`) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`.


## Directed vs Undirected

- An `Undirected Graph` is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

- `Directed Graphs (Digraph)` : A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected


**Complete Graphs**
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

**Connected**
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

**Disconnected**
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

**Acyclic Graph**
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

- A directed acyclic graph is also called a DAG. This can also be represented as what we know as a **tree**.

**Cyclic Graphs**
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.
